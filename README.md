<h1>Unofficial TweetDeck Standalone Client</h1>
<p>The goal of this project was to bring back the TweetDeck Desktop client that they stopped support for a while back. While this is basically an Electron wrapped website, I've modified the project to have a few new features.</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Notifications letting the user know about new features. This will be something that will persist and there will be at least one notification pointing to the changelog in the future.</li>
  <li>Minimize and Close of the window will send it to the taskbar. You will be notified when this happens so you don't think you've closed the program when it's still running.</li>
  <li>Global Hotkey support. Press Ctrl+Alt+Shift+T to hide or show the window. Regardless of visibility, the app will continue running.</li>
  <li>Window size will be remembered between uses. Future updates will build on this for saving other information if the user wishes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Have suggestions, questions, or issues? Post in the Issues tab and I'll be more than happy to help.</p>
